# ArtWebsite
Building a simple interface to display my art pieces, and possibly route people to my insta to interact/commission/buy.

Working with Django because that's what I used most recently, and because I know how to connect a Django project to PythonAnywhere, so that I can run my site for free!

First time running:
'''
pip install django
django-admin startproject artwebsite
cd artwebsite
python manage.py startapp site
'''

Note that if you make a change to the css and the changes aren't immediately visible, try cmd + f5. 

PythonAnywhere app skeleton has been tentatively created. Link for cloning project into bash console:

Link for creating github SSH key, which will need to be put in .gitignore and stored with project:
