# ArtWebsite
Building a simple interface to display my art pieces, and possibly route people to my insta to interact/commission/buy.

Working with Django because that's what I used most recently, and because I know how to connect a Django project to PythonAnywhere, so that I can run my site for free!

First time running:
'''
pip install django
django-admin startproject artwebsite
cd artwebsite
python manage.py startapp site
'''
